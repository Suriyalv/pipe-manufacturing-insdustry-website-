          <center><div><h1>Pipe Fittings</h1><h2 style="text-align: left;">Pipe fittings are essential components used to connect, redirect, or control the flow of liquids or gases within a piping system. They come in various types, each serving a specific function. Here are some common types of pipe fittings:<br><br>

            Elbows: Elbows are used to change the direction of a pipe run. They come in different angles, such as 45 degrees or 90 degrees, and can be either short-radius or long-radius depending on the application.<br>
            Tees: Tees have three connection points and are used to create branches in a pipeline, allowing flow in two directions perpendicular to the main pipe.<br>
            Reducers: Reducers are used to connect pipes of different sizes or diameters. They come in concentric and eccentric configurations, with concentric reducers maintaining a uniform centerline and eccentric reducers offsetting the centerline.<br>
            Couplings: Couplings are used to join two pipes of the same diameter together. They are typically threaded or socket weld for easy installation.<br>
            Unions: Unions are similar to couplings but are designed for easier disassembly of pipes or fittings for maintenance or repairs.<br>
            Adapters: Adapters are used to connect pipes with different end types, such as male or female threads, or different materials, like PVC to metal pipes.<br>
            Caps and Plugs: Caps are used to seal the end of a pipe, while plugs are used to close off an opening temporarily. They can have threaded, socket weld, or butt weld connections.<br>
            Crosses: Crosses have four connection points and are used to create branches in a pipeline, allowing flow in three directions perpendicular to the main pipe.<br>
            Reducers and Expanders: Similar to reducers, these fittings are used to transition between pipes of different diameters, but reducers decrease size while expanders increase size.<br>
            Olets and Branch Connections: Olets are fittings used for branch connections in piping systems.They include weldolets, sockolets, threadolets, and others, each suited for specific applications and installation methods.
